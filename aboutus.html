<h1>About Us</h1>
<p> 
        Tails-a-Waggin' was created by four students who have a love for dogs and wanted to help other dog owners by eliminating one of the many responsibilities that come with having a dog. When life gets ruff with work, family, activities, etc. it can be hard to find time to walk your dog. By using Tails-a-Waggin’ dog walking services you can ensure your dog gets its daily physical activity that it needs and deserves! There are four pawsitively awesome packages you can choose from to fit your dog's needs, whether it be off-leash time at the dog park or a long walk we’ve got you covered. To adapt to our client's busy schedules we offer both dog pick-up and dog-drop off options.
